I don’t care what anyone says about you. I’m still sending you this Thanksgiving and claiming you as family.
Thanksgiving’s Day is all about love, and [Mom], there is no one better than you at spreading God’s love wherever you go.
Eating a little chocolate cake in your honor, [Dad]. It’s not as good as yours, but it still brings back good memories of Thanksgiving’s Days growing up!
Love you and miss you, [Mom]! Looking forward to seeing you next month at [Casey’s party]!

The sense of smell, more than sight, hearing or even taste, is where we store our most cherished and vintage memories. 
 But more than the food we savor, it is the scent of the feast that we love and that endures.
 Not only is it a holiday filled with fabulous eating, family and football, but it is also the day when we give our diets a hall pass, stuffing ourselves in a way we would never dream of the other 364 days of the year.
 Thanksgiving dinner is our favorite meal of the year. 
 Family is the foundation. Grandparents, parents, uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, nieces and grandkids. Russian model Irina Shayk once said “Nothing is better than going home to family and eating good food and relaxing”.
The air we breathe every day. We can live without food and water for a while, but without air we wouldn’t survive beyond a few minutes.
Children bring such love and light to your life. It might be your kids, nieces, nephews, or grandkids. There would be no tight hugs, no surprises, endless love and chaos without kids. Enjoy them while they are young.
Without our parents, we would not be here! Our parents have sacrificed a lot to make our lives as comfortable and loving as possible. If you are lucky enough to have your parents still with you, thank them and take care of them as much as possible because they will not be around forever.
Thank you for all the moms around the world for loving us unconditionally without any questions. They are a source of comfort, a beacon of safety and a positive influence in our lives.
Thank you for all the dads that taught us to be strong-willed, to be fighters, to be gentlemen and to have honor in life.  Thank you for treating all mothers and daughters like queens and princesses.

What is life without friends who will stick with you through thick and thin? Friends who will go with you for scooter rides, parties, going to movies and laughing at you whenever you’re being silly.








The mouth watering smell of a homemade Thanksgiving dinner fills the air. 
Every room in the house is intoxicated with this sensationally delicious thanksgiving aroma.
 When dinner is called upon, the shuffling footsteps of my famine family can be heard miles from the house.
  As we all are gathered around the long, rectangular oak wood table, covered in a crème colored cloth, a sudden warm, content feeling is felt. 
  The lighting is dim to nothing.
   Although there are several lengthy candles lit, it is the presence of each other’s faces that light the dining room.

Once grace is said, the feast finally begins.
 Several long tables consist of various dishes; Italians do it big.
  No one cubic inch of table is left empty.
   In the center of the table is the large turkey.
    It is the size of four footballs, an awfully big, bulky, bird. 
   Surrounding the turkey, like the planets orbiting the sun, are diverse dishes. 
   There are several mountains of potatoes, fluffy marshmallow/sweet potatoes and grandma’s finest mashed potatoes. 
   The pale colored mountains of rich, creamy deliciousness sit next to a sea of boiling gravy. 
   There is also the stuffing. This dish assorted with various foods including: chopped meat, vegetables, and different spices. This delicious dinner is followed up by an even more delicious desert. 
   Various chocolate covered fruits can be found. Two diverse sweet nesses mixed together, providing your taste buds with a mini shock of sugariness. 
   The brownies are always superior. 
   The brown, baked, batches have a hard chocolate shell on the outside and an overflow of chocolate in the inside; when a bite is taken from this dessert a waterfall of chocolate oozes into your mouth.
    But the true superstar of desserts is grandma’s fresh from the oven apple pies.
    The thick and crunchy bread, guards the sweet cinnamon syrup and apple custards on the inside.

This Thanksgiving dinner was sure to be a memorable one. The food was not the best part though. 
The best part was sharing not only a delicious dinner, but the whole night with the loving and good cooking family.
