Love is the emblem of eternity: it confounds all notion of time: effaces all memory of a beginning, all fear of an end.
 I don’t understand why Cupid was chosen to represent Valentine’s Day. When I think about romance, the last thing on my mind is a short, chubby toddler coming at me with a weapon.
 A valentine is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit, a golden thread to the meaning of life.
 Love is what makes two people sit in the middle of a bench when there is plenty of room at both ends.
Pure love is a willingness to give without a thought of receiving anything in return.
It still seems like magic every time I remember how love softly touched our hearts bringing in together Happy Valentine’s Day.
Instead of roses or chocolates, I present a gift to you that’s much more special: My continued and endless love! Happy Valentine’s Day and I’ll always love you!
When I met you we were simply acquaintances. Then we became best friends. Now we are life partners. I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!
Happy Valentines Day to the person I could never live without. Everything about you makes my heart soar and I’m so blissfully happy in your presence.
Love is just a four letter word until someone walks into your life and gives it special meaning. Your love has changed my life and I’m so thankful. Happy Valentine’s Day.
There’s nobody else in this world that my heart loves more than you and that my soul cherishes more than you. Happy Valentine’s Day!
