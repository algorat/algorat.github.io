[Dad], I hope you’re feeling really loved today. You are!
Have fun on Valentine’s Day, and don’t eat too much candy.
Hope your day is filled with reminders of how much you’re loved.
As my [Mom]…as a friend…as a Valentine…you’re the best!
You make me laugh. You make me think. You make me really glad we’re [sisters].
Thanks for all you do that makes my life happier (which is a lot!).
I don’t care what anyone says about you. I’m still sending you this valentine and claiming you as family.
Valentine’s Day is all about love, and [Mom], there is no one better than you at spreading God’s love wherever you go.
Eating a little chocolate cake in your honor, [Dad]. It’s not as good as yours, but it still brings back good memories of Valentine’s Days growing up!
Love you and miss you, [Mom]! Looking forward to seeing you next month at [Casey’s party]!
Happy Valentine’s Day, Sweetheart.
It’s so sweet having a [daughter] like you. Hope your Valentine’s Day is extra sweet, too.
Love you bunches and bunches.
Happy Valentine’s Day to one of our sweetest blessings.
Missing you and sending you a big Valentine hug!
We love you oodles and oodles, [Aidan]!
Hope you get lots of fun treats today! XOXOXO,
U R 2 Cute!
Wishing a fantastic day to my favorite [8]-year-old Valentine!
Hope your day is filled with fun and your mouth is filled with chocolate!
Hope your day is just as awesome as you are!
Sweet treats on Valentine’s Day help us remember to be sweet to each other. And you’re one of the sweetest kids ever!
Happy Valentine’s Day, Gorgeous.
Wishing the sweetest, happiest day to my forever Valentine.
Tonight is all ours. I can’t wait to celebrate with you.
Especially today, I hope you feel how much I love you and how grateful I am to have you in my life.
You take my breath away. Always.
You have no idea how sexy you are.
I couldn’t ask for a more wonderful [husband] than you.
My heart is all yours.
Thanks for being you and for being mine.
I love all the adventures we have together.
This will definitely be a kids-in-bed-early kind of night. XOXOXO
God is good. I know because he gave me you to love.
I’m so excited to be sharing our first Valentine’s Day together. I hope it’s the first of many…
Wish you were here for me to spoil today.
Has it really been [10] years? I’d do it all over in a heartbeat.
Hope your day brings just what you want it to.
Thanks for being the loyal and caring [friend] you are. Love you!
Here’s to a Valentine’s Day filled with good wine, good food and especially good friends like you.
Happy Valentine’s to one of my favorite people. Ever.
Valentine’s Day and every day, I’m grateful for you.
Hope he spoils you. You deserve it.
Someday, our princes will come.
Wish we could be together swapping chocolates and laughing over candy hearts like we used to.
I’ll raise an awesome Valentine’s cocktail to you.
I hope you feel loved and appreciated on Valentine’s Day. Because you are.
